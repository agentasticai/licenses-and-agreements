19. Overview. You may be allowed to interact with our Services in a variety of formats (we call these ‚ÄúInputs‚Äù). Our Services may generate responses based on your Inputs (we call these ‚ÄúOutputs‚Äù). Inputs and Outputs collectively are ‚ÄúCustomer Content.‚Äù
20. Outputs.
21. Reliance on Outputs. Artificial intelligence and large language models are frontier technologies that are still improving in accuracy, reliability and safety. When you use our Services, you acknowledge and agree:
    1. Outputs may not always be accurate and may contain material inaccuracies even if they appear accurate because of their level of detail or specificity.
    2. You should not rely on any Outputs without independently confirming their accuracy.
    3. The Services and any Outputs may not reflect correct, current, or complete information.
    4. Outputs may contain content that is inconsistent with AGENTASTIC‚Äôs views.
22. Limitations of Outputs; Notice to Users. It is Customer‚Äôs responsibility to evaluate whether Outputs are appropriate for Customer‚Äôs use case, including where human review is appropriate, before using or sharing Outputs. Customer acknowledges, and must notify its Users, that factual assertions in Outputs should not be relied upon without independently checking their accuracy, as they may be false, incomplete, misleading or not reflective of recent events or information. Customer further acknowledges that Outputs may contain content inconsistent with AGENTASTIC‚Äôs views.
23. Customer Content.
24. Rights to Customer Content. You are responsible for all Inputs you submit to our Services. By submitting Inputs to our Services, you represent and warrant that you have all rights, licenses, and permissions that are necessary for us to process the Inputs under our Terms and to provide the Services to you, including for example, to integrate with third-party services and to share Customer Content with others at your direction. You also represent and warrant that your submitting Inputs to us will not violate our Terms, our [Acceptable Use Policy](https://agentastic.app/terms-of-service), or any laws or regulations applicable to those Inputs. As between you and AGENTASTIC, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, you retain any right, title, and interest that you have in the Inputs you submit. Subject to your compliance with our Terms, we assign to you all of our right, title, and interest - if any - in Outputs.
25. Training on Customer Content. AGENTASTIC will not train models on Customer Content from Services.
26. Other Use of Customer Content. We may use Customer Content in aggregate, anonymized form to provide, maintain, and improve the Services and to develop other products and services.
27. Similarity of Customer Content.¬†Due to the nature of our Services and artificial intelligence generally, Input and Output may not be unique and other users may receive similar Output from our Services. Our assignment of rights to you above does not extend to other users‚Äô Output.
28. **SUSPENSION**
29. Unless we specifically agree otherwise in a separate agreement with you, we reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Services or your access to the Services, in whole or in part, at any time without notice to you. Although we will strive to provide you with reasonable advance notice if we stop offering a Service, there may be urgent situations - such as preventing abuse, responding to legal requirements, or addressing security and operability issues - where providing advance notice is not feasible. We will not be liable for any change to or any suspension or discontinuation of the Services or your access to them.
30. AGENTASTIC may suspend Customer‚Äôs access to any portion or all of the Services if: (i) Customer‚Äôs use of the Services poses a security risk, may violate the [Acceptable Use Policy](https://agentastic.app/terms-of-service), or may adversely affect the Services, AGENTASTIC‚Äôs systems and infrastructure, or a third party; or (ii) Customer is in breach of this Agreement.
31. AGENTASTIC will use reasonable efforts to provide written notice of any Service Suspension to Customer, and resume providing access to the Services, as soon as reasonably possible after the event giving rise to the Service Suspension is cured, where curable.

The party raising the Dispute must notify the other party in accordance with Section 14(a) above. The other party will respond to such notice within 15 days. If the parties have not resolved the dispute within 45 days of delivery of the initial dispute notice, either party may seek to resolve the dispute through arbitration as stated below.
30. Except for equitable relief described in Section 14(q) above, any Dispute will be determined in English by final, binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Commercial Arbitration Rules by a single arbitrator. The arbitration will take place in Seattle, Washington. Judgment on any award issued through the arbitration process may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. EACH PARTY AGREES THEY ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY, AND THE RIGHT TO JOIN AND PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER THE LAW IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS.
